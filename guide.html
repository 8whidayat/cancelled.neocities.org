      <p>This is a comprehensible guide to easily cancelling the target of your choice.</p>
      <p>Why? Because this is the Internet and if someone isn't angry then it isn't the Internet.</p>
      <p>Before we cancel, visit <a href="index-2.html#Cancelling Reasons">here</a> to see the reasons people cancel someone.</p>
      <p>There's also a guide there to give you a step-by-step guide to cancel someone but that is simplified and this guide is much more better.</p>
      <h1>Let's begin.</h1><br>
      We have to prepare first, then attack second.
      <p class="header">Step 1. Pick a target</p>
      <p>Controversial targets won't work because people already know that they are problematic and won't do anything when they get targeted.</p>
      <p>Instead pick a target that doesn't have a controversial history or is a target that has a good reception to make people shocked.</p>
      <p class="header">Step 2. Pick your weapon</p>
      <p>There are multiple types of weapons to use against the target:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A "deleted" twitter post that is offensive</li>
        <li>A discord message of the target saying something offensive.</li>
        <li>The target donating/following/cooperating with an offensive person.</li>
        <li>The target "doing" something offensive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are more weapons to use but this is a general list.</p>
      <p class="header">Step 3. Pick a platform.</p>
      <p>This can range from YouTube to Twitter. Twitter has the highest concentration of Cancel Culture so it makes sense that people cancel from here. </p>
      <p>For the best chance to cancel, use Twitter for the aformentioned reasons.</p>
      <p class="header">Step 4. Fabricate.</p>
      <p>Fabricating has a good chance of getting your target cancelled as people believe fabricated content without any question.</p>
      <p>A fabricated twitter post looks something like this:<p>
      <img src="images/juj.jpg">
      <p>If you get offended by this post, because it was designed that way.</p>
      <p>Pay attention to the use of black people and homosexual people because these breeds of people are valued the most by the Internet.</p>
      <p>The negative message here involving these valued people will make you angry and not make you think if this is legit or not. Genius!</p><br>
      <p>To fabricate a post, go to the target's Twitter if they have one. And pick a message that they posted.</p>
      <p>Now, press Ctrl+Shift+C or right-click and select Inspect Element.</p>
      <p>Change the message there to contain something offensive (and believable.)</p>
      <p>And remove any images, hashtags or emojis in the message if there is any to tidy it all up.</p>
      <p>Once you're done, press the Print Screen button on your keyboard to capture your desktop.</p>
      <p>Open up MS Paint, press CTRL+V to paste your image. And finally crop everything except the message.</p>
      <p>And that's it! Save the image.</p>
      <p class="header">Step 5. Fire!</p>
      <p>Once you have successfully fabricated an offensive material from the target, go to Twitter and make an account if you don't have one.</p>
      <p>Next make a tweet including the tweet with captions like "An old deleted tweet found from [target]'s Twitter. DISGUSTING".</p>
      <p>Include hashtags like #[target]isoverparty or #racist to help better your chance of getting it popular.</p>
      <p>Post it and now just wait.</p>
      <p class="header">Step 6. Confirm.</p>
      <p>Check if the target made an apology or they have been "cancelled" and lost their reputation.</p>
      <p>If so, then you did it!</p>
      <p>If not and it backfired on you, here's the list of options to choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Insist that the fabricated content is real.</li>
        <li>Say the people only want injustice.</li>
        <li>"You are [the offending material the fabricated content consists of] and support them."</li>
        <li>"How does the world stand behind [the offending material the fabricated content consists of]?!"</li>
        <li>Recruit conspiratorial people to come to your defense. People that believe in conspiracies always put their fingers in their ears and most definitely will support you.</li>
        <li>Use ad hominems and contact celebrites to come to your aid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If it still didn't work, then you're fucked. But hey, atleast you tried.</p>
