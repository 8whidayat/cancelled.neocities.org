    <h1>This is 50 reasons to <b style="color:red;text-style:bold;">NOT</b> use NeoCities.</h1><br><br>
    And before you call me a hypocrite, I am using NeoCities because I have to make this page in order for the idiots like you to see. So shut the FUCK up, put duct tape around your mouth and read.<br><br>
       
    <ol start="1">
    <li>There is no FTP or any kind of way to transfer the shit out of your "website" unless you use the browser editor. NeoCities CLI is available but that helps with jack shit.</li>
       
    <li>Using the browser editor also means that if your internet gets knocked offline you will not be able to save whatever you were doing until the internet comes online.</li>
       
    <li>Updating JavaScript takes a while. So that means you will have no clue if your JavaScript file is working correctly or not unless you put the JavaScript in your HTML file.</li>
    
    <li>Why is only front-end languages allowed? If NeoCities can host 300,000 websites like they proudly say and give each of them a gigabyte of storage to fuck around with, they shouldn't be cutting corners when it comes to back-end languages.</li>
    
    <li>If you think this is a genuine free website provider, you are an idiot. FreeWebHostingArea costs nothing, they have 1.5 GB of storage, can access FTP anytime and they have PHP, MySQL and PMA. X10Hosting also costs nothing. Or otherwise they wouldn't cut a million corners if they can host 300,000 websites each taking 1GB.</li>
    
    <li>Speaking of those 300,000 websites... That would mean they are hosting 300,000 GB or about 291 TB. How much does that cost? If assuming each drive they are using is the cheapest <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=10748&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=trd-us-1258118662540862500&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F32657147484.html">SSD at 1TB for 25% off meaning $0.79 per GB</a> that means this costs about $237,000+ USD. If assuming HDD, costing about 60 dollars per TB (or $0.60 per GB) that means this costs about $180,000+ dollars. Let's put the estimate on 200,000 US dollars. Assuming this is how much it costs, why would they not let you use PHP or back-end programming if they can afford all this storage for that much money?</li>
    
    <li>According to most website valuing sources, NeoCities is worth ~$100,000. So then how do they keep their site up if the storage costs more than the website is worth?</li>
    
    <li>Since NeoCities is built on a similar style to GeoCities (if the fucking name isn't obvious...) that means people also want to make it old-school. But unfortunately NeoCities's shitty certificate because it is using HTTPS doesn't let you view your own website in older browsers.
    
    <li>Plus why the fuck would you want this shit? Only HTML, JavaScript and CSS (plus font formats). That's it? If you are that fucking poor you can get plenty of free web hosting or actually spend your dollars and get a proper domain. You have full access over domains you buy.
    
    <li>Now let's talk about the community. Because holy shit it is diverse. No supercomputer or quantumcomputer can count the amount of people that identify themselves as binary, gay, bisexual, lesbian or whatever the fuck. I would be suprised if one person here didn't identify their sexualities as anything. Not to trigger all you LGBTQ+ losers here but I am actually tired of seeing this shit. I wan't to see atleast ONE person here that doesn't display their sexualities as if it is their trophies.</li>
    
    <li>Plus what's up with the Columbiners here? The fuck is wrong with you? Just because they did it doesn't mean YOU should do it. You need fucking help, teenager. Go talk to your parents about your problems.
    
    <li>Most pages here are filled distilled garbage, AIDS and autism. Edginess, horrible memes, self-awareness and SJW agendas all over the place. If GeoCities is what this site was inspired from then I don't remember GeoCities users posting about Donald Trump or politics.</li>
    
    <li>And most of the users are retarded Gen Z people thinking they are cool for having a subdomain of a locked-down cookie-cutter site. They post all their thoughts and feelings in there as if they directly connected their brains and uploading their easily triggerable thoughts into their sites. Maybe you can upload on NeoCities. If you wired your brain there that is.</li>
    
    <li>And all of these people appear to be Tumblr degenerates. People like you belong on a cross.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://898448898984.neocities.org/">There are bots already popping up trying fish/scam/maliciously do something to the user.</a> The title translates to "OMG!!! You won't believe this!"</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://4456465486.neocities.org/">Another bot.</a> This one literally says: "Amazing!!! 14-year-old teenager raped in Barcelona, Spain". That's right, AMAZING!!!</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://lr1.neocities.org/">I don't have explain anything here. Just look at it yourself.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://merey-loser.neocities.org/">This is the best website ShiteoCities will ever have.</a> Not even being sarcastic. No site can get better than this.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://mason123.neocities.org/">Microsoft Fanboy. I'm convinced this dumbass is 11 and he made this on his mom's computer.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://princesstoots.neocities.org/">There is a reason why Autism Charities exist.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://xsvpn.neocities.org/">A shady VPN.</a> Don't worry guys! It says "China optimized" so it's fine.</li>
    
    <li>In addition to VPNs, shitty websites (except the merey-loser one) and retarded people, there is an over-abundance of furries and weeaboos here. The site was more diverse than I thought it would be.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://meandmygun.neocities.org/2.html">Expect</a> <a href="https://wrathofdogma.neocities.org/killmankind.html">these</a> <a href="https://sadness-is-cool.neocities.org/">people</a> to do the shit I was talking about earlier.
    
    <li><a href="https://thecolumbinevorecult.neocities.org/">This might be a troll website. Pretty funny.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://moonview.neocities.org/links.html">This cunt literally links to CWCki.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://l4nn1312.neocities.org/about/">You'll never find a person like this.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://fujitruth.neocities.org/">Tumblr whore moans about the sexuality of a fictional character.</a> *sigh*</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://bulletpoint.neocities.org/">Shitty vaporwave PlayStation-obsessed site.</a> It also says "if you didn't have a tumblr did you even have a life?"</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://makotoyuki2.neocities.org/">Another autistic kid. Don't look at their YouTube channel.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://cinni.neocities.org/about.html">Quite literally the worst site I have had the honor of making my eyes look at.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://angall.neocities.org/">This retard is very paranoid about his "privacy".</a> Expect him to flee towards a village carrying a Windows 98 machine with Dial-up internet.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://peche.neocities.org/">Weaboo fangirl who just discovered the Internet.</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="https://minecraftcoric.neocities.org/">Autistic kid that plays Minecraft and FNAF. Has ADHD and definitely Autism.</a></li>
    
    <li><a style="text-size:24px;" href="https://afterlifeinthelimelight.neocities.org/">UNHOLY SHIT.</a> To add insult to injury, he is 19.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://whynowhy.neocities.org/">Another weaboo loser.</a> Even the comments on her YouTube channel say cringe.</li>
    
    <li>Why would you wanna write your shit here even if you accepted the millions of corner-cuts and limits they imposed? So you can post about how you took the 5th shit today and was proud of it because you're gay? So you can "escape" social media?</li>
    
    <li>Unless you are that nostalgiatard oldfag, social media is 6 trillion times better than NeoCities. They don't give you HTML or JavaScript, yes sure, but the only thing you ever need is to post about the 5th shit today and was proud of it because you're gay. The fuck are you gonna do with HTML? Make your MySpace profile? Oh god what a shit site that was. And if you really want HTML and Web stuff like that, GET. A. FUCKING. WEBSITE.</li>
    
    <li>Everyone I see here (who actually managed to learn what the fuck HTML and JS was) always has a blog where they complain, cry, whine and then repeat the cycle again. People on GeoCities didn't do that and I know for a fact they didn't. They only had updates or a diary (where they DON'T complain.)</li>
    
    <li>Don't take it from me, here's a person saying why they are <a href="https://joppiesaus.neocities.org/div/mir/owlman.neocities.org/library_midnight_18.html">quitting NeoCities. (The reasons why are also similar to here.)</a> However this guy is 12-13 and he is retarded so maybe you should take it from me.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://invisibleup.neocities.org/articles/25/">Another person quitting NeoCities.</a> Reason? No templates, having the change each HTML file one-by-one, having to manually move everything, no easy way to copy files (FTP).</li>

    <li>And even if you got Supporter ($5 per month), what's the fucking point then? It's not that different from running an actual website, plus the limits are lessened a little but you still are capped to 50GB. You also get WebDAV which the person quitting NeoCities above I mentioned said that it is very hard to get it to work. Still no FTP. And you can use your custom domain on it which again like I said, WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?</li>
    
    <li>According to <a href="https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/month-to-month-web-hosting/">this page</a> 9 of 18 web hosting plans cost fewer or equal to 5 dollars per month. And according to <a href="https://webhostingpaymonthly.com/">this page</a> 2 of 5 web hosting providers cost fewer or equal to 5 dollars per month. You could be get a website on those web hosting plans with much more good shit than NeoCities's Supporter plan.
    
    <li><a href="https://neocities.org/site_files/allowed_types">Here are the allowed types. That's right, fuck you.</a> Notice how they say going to Supporter reduces the file dump disk which is a retarded argument. If a Supporter pays only 5$ for a 10GB MP4 file on 3000GB bandwidth, that doesn't really sound like reducing to me.</li>
    
    <li>NeoCities says it's "free", when in reality that's bullshit. It's freeMIUM.</li>
    
    <li>And NeoCities isn't empowering the development of creative independent websites, infact the opposite. The only thing it's helping is testing your capabilites of making a static website through frustration.</li>
    
    <li>I still wan't to reiterate, WHY. IS. IT. CUTTING CORNERS?! A site that can host 300,000 websites each of them at 1GB. 200 grand cost. WHY?! Is back-end programming that hard for you when storage is like Play-doh?</li>
    
    <li>And the community is awful, cancerous, autistic and a hivemind of LGBTQNSDAQ+ people who think they are above the rest because they are LGBTQ+.</li>
    
    <li>Worse, the press likes to brand it as a "GeoCities-revival" when it is shittier than GeoCities itself.</li>
    
    <li>You can find a couple good websites here, but that's A COUPLE. You can find some good JavaScript games and artistic works through coding, BUT THAT'S IT! That's all there is in this fucking shit-hole.</li>
    
    <li>And if you think you have your own website and you're all cool n' shit by having one here then you are either poor, blinded by nostalgia or you think social media "is pure evil" and this is your escape when that would be the case if billions of people weren't using it.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    <h1>My Conclusion?</h1>
    <p>Fuck NeoCities. If you have more reasons why, gladly tell them in my profile and I'll expand my page if it's worthy.</p>
