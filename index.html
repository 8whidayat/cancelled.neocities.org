      <h1 style="text-size:32px;">This site has been cancelled.</h1><br>
      <p>What does this mean? According to Urban Dictionary, the top definition is "To dismiss something/somebody or to reject an individual/idea.".</p>
      <p>Essentially the idea is that once you have reached Cancelled status, your reputation on the internet has tarnished and an angry mob of Twitter maniacs and commentary YouTubers obsess over your negatives and incidents.</p>
      <h1><i>How do you get cancelled? Easy!</i></h1>
      <p>The majority of users on the internet are nowadays merciless virgin losers using Twitter to tear anything in their way like a Great White Shark. To get cancelled, we first have to see what makes these people cry.</p>

      <ul id="Cancelling Reasons">
        <li>Calling out K-POP artists.</li>
        <li>Because of the abundance of retards all of a sudden caring about "Black Lives Matter" like its the 1950s, anything that remotely says the word or the race "black" or something to do with "blackface" will automatically be racist no matter the context or the usage, getting you cancelled no matter your defense or your stance. What do I think? Honestly, fuck all races. And fuck you too. #NoLivesMatter.</li>
        <li>Saying that Trump is a good person.</li>
        <li>Saying that you <i>don't like or have a negative opinion</i> towards gay, trans, lesbian or LGTBQNSDAQFASCIST+ people. This is the best chance of you getting cancelled as LGBTQYMCAWTFBBQ+ people are the easiest to get triggered and offended.</li>
        <li>Saying that you don't like Chinese people when the reason we got infected and quarantined is LITERALLY BECAUSE OF THE STUPID FUCKS.</li>
        <li>Saying something negative about females. Females generally get pissed off when their feelings are hurt as they expect you to kiss their fat asses. This also has a good chance of you getting cancelled.</li>
        <li>Saying Micheal Jackson is not a bad person.</li>
        <li>Saying that Men are better than Women as Women's only purpose is for sex. This has a good chance of you getting cancelled as Women will tear you into pieces if you speak the truth.</li>
        <li>Saying the dreaded "N-Word". This has a 96% chance of you getting cancelled. However some have managed to avoid being cancelled saying it.</li>
        <li>Saying something about police. This phrase is unacceptable to say as police are now a symbol of racism in 2020. This will ultimately get you cancelled immediately.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1><i>How do you cancel someone else? This is also easy!</i></h1>
      <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to cancel someone easily.</p>
  </center>
      <ul>
        <li>As we have seen that Twitter is home to most maniacs, we will use this.</li>
        <li>Now, pick a person or a celebrity. Good celebrities can also be picked. Charities too.</li>
        <li>Since cancelling is done by something being racist, sexist or "LGBTQPhobic", fabricate a document or a paper or a Twitter message from the aformentioned target.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the fabricated is very offensive and not easily detectable as fake.</li>
        <li>Once you have made a personal gullible angry mob army, target their sponsors, the jobs they work in and the revenue they work to get.</li>
        <li>Don't worry about the target trying to defend himself as cancelled people's defenses are always ignored.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So now that you have understood the basics and steps of cancelling, go cancel someone! Be the hero! Make your own army!</p>
